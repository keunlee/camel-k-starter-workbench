# Camel K: Starter Workbench Samples

These samples show how Camel K can be used as glue for connecting various eventing platforms together (**Knative Eventing**, **Kafka** and **AMQ**) to develop advanced real-life applications.

## [Preparing the Cluster](docs/SETUP.md)

These examples can be run on any OpenShift 4.3+ cluster or a local development instance (such as [CRC](https://github.com/code-ready/crc)). Ensure that you have a cluster available and login to it using the OpenShift `oc` command line tool.
